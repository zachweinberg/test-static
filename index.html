This dialogue continued, drawing from their diverse backgrounds in tech and startups, and they never stopped pushing the limits of what was possible to reimagine the way things should be, and from that first pot of tea, the alignment on the shared vision to fix what was broken never stopped. Over thousands of cups of tea, the vision expanded from napkins and sketches, to whiteboards and project planning, to a business plan and a pitch deck, and ultimately raising $5.3 million in venture capital. The first version of RedDoor launched six months later.</p></div><div class="row"><div class="col"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmbpzwuat/image/upload/v1635760974/home.png" class="img-fluid img-style mx-auto d-block" /><label class="mg-md label-bloc-2-style text-lg-center">RedDoor home delivers a delightful 60 second<br>verified and accurate pre-approval.</label></div><div class="col"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmbpzwuat/image/upload/v1635760973/hero.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-style" /><label class="mg-md label-bloc-2-style text-lg-center">RedDoor HERO connects real estate agents with their clients through the entire pre-approval process<br></label></div></div><p class="p-2-style mg-md">RedDoor also built the evolution of how loan officers do their work with our proprietary backend system that manages all aspects of the engagement and approval process, maximizing conversion and efficiency while delivering a high delight score.

Growing up, Heather spent summers in her grandparent&rsquo;s real estate office, and watched as buyers came in toting the real estate section of the newspaper with houses circled and then they sat down on the red leather couches and looked through the enormous black binders full of MLS listings to determine what homes they wanted to see. Today, anyone can search online or from their phone and find all of the homes for sale, and even make and receive offers from their couch. What hasn't changed much is how you get your financing, what options you actually have access to, and how painfully difficult the entire process is.<br><br>Over the years, we talked to hundreds of borrowers about this process. Across the board, no matter how many homes they have bought or how many college degrees they have, people feel overwhelmed with the process, and don't know if they are ever seeing all of their options. As they are going through the painful process of getting pre-approved and try to complain about it, the answer they typically hear from their real estate agent and loan officer goes something like this, "This is just how it is; you have to go along with it because there is no other way.‚Äù<br><br>We always believed that there was a better way, and we knew we could build a verified 60 second pre-approval process, and deliver a magical experience instead of a painful one, for everyone involved.
